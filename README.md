# üõ°Ô∏è Password Strength Analyzer

A powerful and user-friendly desktop application to analyze password strength in real-time. This tool serves as a defensive security utility, helping users understand the weaknesses in their passwords and learn how to create stronger ones. It features both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Detailed Strength Analysis:** Provides a comprehensive analysis using Dropbox's `zxcvbn` library, including a score (0-4), estimated crack time, and actionable feedback.
  * **Real-time GUI Feedback:** The graphical interface analyzes passwords and updates a visual strength bar *as you type*.
  * **Visual Strength Bar:** An intuitive, color-coded progress bar gives immediate visual feedback on password strength (Red $\rightarrow$ Orange $\rightarrow$ Yellow $\rightarrow$ Blue $\rightarrow$ Green).
  * **Educational Warnings & Suggestions:** Offers specific warnings (e.g., "This is a top-10 common password") and suggestions (e.g., "Add another word or two").
  * **Versatile CLI Tool:** Includes a feature-rich CLI for terminal users, capable of checking passwords against user-provided personal information (names, dates, pets) to highlight their risks.
  * **Cross-Platform:** Built with Python and Tkinter, it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üöÄ Usage

You can run either the GUI application or the CLI tool.

### üñ•Ô∏è GUI Version

For a user-friendly experience, run the GUI application.

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python strength_gui.py
    ```
3.  A window will appear. Simply start typing in the password field to see the real-time analysis.

### ‚å®Ô∏è CLI Version

For terminal power-users, the CLI provides more advanced options.

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  **Basic Usage:** Run the script with a password as an argument. **Remember to use quotes\!**
    ```bash
    python strength_analyzer.py "MyP@ssword123!"
    ```
3.  **Advanced Usage (Checking against personal info):**
    Use the `-i` or `--inputs` flag to provide a list of words to check against. This demonstrates how personal information weakens a password.
    ```bash
    python strength_analyzer.py "Fluffy2025!" -i Fluffy 2025 Nachi
    ```
